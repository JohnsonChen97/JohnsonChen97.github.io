      <p id="w-node-4d42c7dcc5f8-90648e23" class="paragraph-5"><strong>The Project</strong><br><br>In my third year of university, one of the assignments that my partner and I were tasked with was to create a website that advocated for proper use of marijuana. This topic was was given to us due to the recent legalization of marijuana in Canada. Our website had to include various other forms of content, such as a quiz, game, form of media, and a few others. All the content had to be related to the message of proper cannabis usage. The goal of the website was to allow users of all ages to learn about the safety precautions that individuals should take to ensure the safety of themselves and the people around them. In the end, our users should leave our website feeling they have gained knowledge on the matter. We conducted research on the various types of cannabis users to determine the level of information we displayed. Our research consisted of our team surveying our friends, classmates, and doing some online analysis. The results showed us that many people that consume cannabis, in fact are not consistent users of the plant but only consume it on special occasions. This led us to the conclusion that we should incorporate various levels of information, whether you are an avid user, or even have never touched it.<br><br>Between my partner and I, my role was designing/creating the website. This being the first time I was largely in charge of designing an entire website, I took inspiration from other popular websites to conceptualize a design. The graphics on the other hand were created with simplicity in mind to not distract or overwhelm users.<br><br><br><strong>The Process<br><br></strong>Once I was done with getting inspiration from the internet, I had decided on how the website will look like. The steps taken to get to the final product were:<br><br>    1. Rough sketch of design on paper.<br><br>    2. Creating hifi mockup in Figma.<br><br>    3. Made website and exported code from Webflow.<br>‍<br></p>

        <p class="paragraph-8">Initially, the website was supposed to require the user to sign up in order to &quot;track their progress&quot;, but this was taken out due to the added hassle and non-practical use it had. We wanted users to simply visit our site and gain the knowledge that would help them. For this reason, we had to scrap some of the ideas we had for a member based site, but the overall design did not change much. <br><br>The main efforts of the design went into the home page as we determined it would be the page to capture our target audience. The choices of colour were meant to reflect our intended visitors as well. Red and white being the colours of the Canadian flag were mainly used to reflect our main message of safe usage in Canada after the legalization. The other pages on the site put little emphasis on design, and more on giving information that is presented in a skimmable way. </p>

      <p id="w-node-09cccf702703-90648e23" class="paragraph-9">The other page I designed was the &quot;Store&quot; page. We implemented a store as it was a form of spreading the message by using our brand/logo to raise awareness and traction to our website. Since stores are also meant to convince visitors to buy the product, design is important on this page as well.</p>
      <p id="w-node-aaf76621cb15-90648e23" class="paragraph-13">A clean and simple look is given to the page that lets the user focus on the products without extra distracting elements.</p>
      <p id="w-node-67d23891d577-90648e23" class="paragraph-14">The user experience journey that is intended would be to feel welcomed by the home page, then continue over to our various forms of learning, such as the info displayed on the learn tab, the quiz, and game. Users should feel inclined to change their cannabis habits, or prevent them from ever happening. They are also able to reinforce this idea by buying our clothes if they wish to. The experience they gain from out website should not come off in a negative way, such as putting up information that won&#x27;t make them any more knowledgeable or happier. Information such as how cannabis could drastically affect your spending habits, or that the drug is associated with &quot;bad&quot; guys. Our goal was to be the central hub for cannabis knowledge. Users are able to quickly visit for a tip or fact and leave knowing where they can find more info.</p>

      <p id="w-node-d0305230bb3a-90648e23" class="paragraph-12"><strong>Learnings</strong><br><br>Designing an entire website was a lot more difficult than I thought, but I&#x27;m glad I got to work on a project like this as I believe it was a valuable experience. I personally do not consume cannabis so I had to do a lot of surveying and research to find out what to include on the website, which taught me that designing for a certain audience requires more than just a designer&#x27;s mind. Even though the website did not go live as it was just a project for school, the constant realization that our topic is in fact a real life situation, helped me visualize how an actual website dedicated to this cause would look like. <br><br></p>
