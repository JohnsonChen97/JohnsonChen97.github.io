Their goal was to continue their outreach to an even larger audience as they are a relatively new company that wants to make moves.<br></p>

        <p class="paragraph-79">When creating the low fidelity mockups, the greatest struggle we had was designing around ad placements. DigitalMex wanted to include at least 8 ads in each page. This was a problem I have never dealt with before. To overcome this, me and my partner decided to move the majority of the ads to the bottom of the page. We wanted to preserve the goal of making each page less cluttered and reached an agreement that this was the ideal solution. </p>

While working on the high fidelity mockups, we still communicated with their office to discuss possible changes and any feedback they had for us even though the low fidelity was completed already. We still were able to implement as many of their requests as possible while making any changes we as designers saw fit. Due to these reasons, our mockups ended up turning out different from our low fidelity version.</p>

Users are able to view the most recent top stories right when they land, but also have access to other stories as they continue to scroll down. Elements such as view count, time of post, and ratings were removed as we noticed most users did not interact with them. Essentially, we made the website less overwhelming to allow users to find the stories they want to read and quickly. </p>

        <p class="paragraph-53"><strong>Takeaways<br><br></strong>I learned a lot as this was my first time working with people overseas on a project like this. The online meetings that happened every other week and having a timeline to work with was fresh to me. The greatest challenge for me was the language/country barrier. Given that I have a very minimal comprehension of Spanish, attempting to get my thoughts and ideas across proved to be pretty difficult, but thankfully my partner was fluent and was able to assist in these areas. There were regulations I had to learn along the way which at times really shocked me, such as the logo which had to be larger than anything else in the nav bar. Digital Mex also had some desired features like including ads in each page and page numbers.<br><br>Overall, I understood the importance of culture when it comes to design and how it could affect the outcome of the product. It was quite an experience having to cater to a whole new user base and country. I really felt that this project made me closer to achieving my goal of being able to create for everyone.<br><br>Check out the website at <a href="https://www.digitalmex.mx/">https://www.digitalmex.mx/ </a>when it&#x27;s ready.</p>
