A fellow classmate of mine was working with them already and I reached out to ask if I can join in. This was a difficult task as I did not speak Spanish fluently which was a bit of a problem. There was also regulations for Mexican websites that I had to learn.<br></p>

        <p class="paragraph-51"><strong>Design Process<br></strong><br>Before starting on a mockup for the website, we spent time looking at other news websites. This included ones from the United States, Canada and of course, Mexico. This greatly helped us find out the common aspects between these kinds of websites. <br><br>Every couple of weeks, we would have to consult with the head office of Digital Mex and give them updates. This was extremely important as there were design concepts and regulations we did not know of since they are only commonplace in Mexico. <br></p>

        <p class="paragraph-8">Being satisfied with the low fidelity mockup, a high fidelity version was started. While working on the high fidelity mockups, we still communicated with higher ups to discuss possible changes and any feedback they had for us even though the low fidelity was completed already. We still were able to implement as many of their requests as possible while making any changes we as designers saw fit. Due to these reasons, our mockups ended up turning out different from our low fidelity version.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-52">The new website aims to improve upon their problems while also providing the visuals of a modern website. Users are able to view the most recent top stories right when they land, but also have access to other stories as they continue to scroll down. Elements such as view count, time of post, and ratings were removed as we noticed most users did not interact with them. Essentially, we made the website less overwhelming to allow users to find the stories they want to read and quickly. </p>

        <p class="paragraph-53"><strong>Takeaways<br><br></strong>I learned a lot as this was my first time working with people overseas on a project like this. The online meetings that happened every other week and having a timeline to work with was fresh to me. The greatest challenge for me was the language/country barrier. Given that I have a very minimal comprehension of Spanish, attempting to get my thoughts and ideas across proved to be pretty difficult, but thankfully my partner was fluent and was able to assist in these areas. There were regulations I had to learn along the way which at times really shocked me, such as the logo which had to be larger than anything else in the nav bar. Digital Mex also had some desired features like including ads in each page and page numbers.<br><br>Overall, I understood the importance of culture when it comes to design and how it could affect the outcome of the product. It was quite an experience having to cater to a whole new user base and country. I really felt that this project made me closer to achieving my goal of being able to create for everyone.<br><br>Check out the website at <a href="https://www.digitalmex.mx/">https://www.digitalmex.mx/ </a>when it&#x27;s ready.</p>
