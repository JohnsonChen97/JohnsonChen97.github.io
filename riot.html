As a part of having a soon to be catalogue of games, I wanted to recreate their League+ app as a central hub for all of Riot&#x27;s games. <br><br>With many video game companies having an app that is for all of their own games, it is likely the Riot will follow suit. Industry leading companies such as Steam and Blizzard have an app that allows users to essentially interact with the community while away from their computers. I believe that Riot has the potential to create an upscale version of the competitors&#x27; by incorporating aspects of League+ into their own. <br><br>League+ is an app for the game League of Legends. It allows users to catch up on news, watch live streams, and of course, message friends. While this is already a great idea for an app, being able to incorporate their upcoming games could make for a more desirable app.<br></p>

        <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>Research<br><br></strong>To start off, I conducted research on a small sample group of 14 League+ users which consisted of young adults/students. The research consisted of a survey with 5 simple questions to determine what they liked and what they didn&#x27;t like about the current app.<br><br>Of the 14 respondents, <strong class="bold-text-8">92.9%</strong> of the users used the app for messaging friends when they are away from their computer. When asked what they would like to see in the app, the most popular answer was to integrate a way to <strong class="bold-text-9">spectate games</strong> of their friends from their mobile device. For the final question, I wanted to see if there would be interest in a similar app but for all the games by Riot instead. <strong class="bold-text-10">42.9%</strong> of users said maybe, <strong class="bold-text-11">21.4%</strong> said likely, and <strong class="bold-text-12">28.6%</strong> said they were extremely likely to use it.<br><br>When asked what they would change about the app in general, the majority of the answers were along the lines of the app being buggy and not appealing. Although fixing bugs in the app is something I couldn&#x27;t provide a solid solution towards, I am able to give the app a makeover. These results also further confirmed my own thoughts on the current app.<br>‍<br><br><strong class="bold-text-45">Market Research</strong><br><br>During this time, I also took a look at apps that would serve the same function as the app I was to redesign. From these similar apps, I was able to notice similarities between them which gave me inspiration towards how the my own redesign will turn out.<br></p>

        <p class="paragraph-77"><strong>Deliver<br></strong><br>With the redesigned app complete, I decided to do a final test with the same participants of the initial survey to determine if it meets their satisfaction. Unfortunately, I could only get results from 10 of the previous 14 people before. The survey consisted of 3 simple questions to gauge their satisfaction and usage with the app. <strong class="bold-text-36">90%</strong> of users said they would use this app for features other than messaging, and <strong class="bold-text-37">80%</strong> of users found this app to be more visually appealing. The final question was to see if users would like to see anything else added. <strong class="bold-text-38">40%</strong> of the users said they would not want anything else added, but the rest of the answers had to do with <strong class="bold-text-39">personal stats</strong>, such as match history, and champion stats being added to the profile page. I believe this would be a great addition to the app that I overlooked when doing research. In the future, when Riot has released their other games, the app could evolve more and further take the user feedback into consideration.</p>

        <h4 class="heading-27">Takeaways</h4>
        <p class="paragraph-47">This is my favourite project to date because I was entirely in control of the ideation and processes which allowed me to explore and learn new design styles. Not to mention that I am also very passionate about this industry!<br><br>I learned that sometimes, a redesign isn&#x27;t meant to be something that is blown out. User needs and wants will range, but as long as I am able to cater to them by creating a great experience for them when using the app, then it is considered a successful redesign. Since this is also my first redesign project, I learned to show restraint as I could&#x27;ve changed elements that were not an issue in the first place.<br>‍<br>The fact that I was designing an app for an already established company made me want to put in more effort in nailing down what users wanted. Ideally, I should have gotten a larger research sample to further back up my basis for my redesign. That way I can truly say that the app is more user friendly for the entire player base.</p>
