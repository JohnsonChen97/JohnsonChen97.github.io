      <p id="w-node-f9475b38-ec7a-e869-21ad-9e4343fc8bef-d863e400" class="paragraph-29"><strong class="bold-text-64">Overview</strong><br><br>Riot Games is making the &quot;s&quot; in Games finally come true. As a part of having a soon to be catalogue of games, I wanted to recreate their League+ app as a central hub for all of Riot&#x27;s games. <br><br>With many video game companies having an app that is for all of their own games, it is likely the Riot will follow suit. Industry leading companies such as Steam and Blizzard have an app that allows users to essentially interact with the community while away from their computers. I believe that Riot has the potential to create an upscale version of the competitors&#x27; by incorporating aspects of League+ into their own. <br><br>League+ is an app for the game League of Legends. It allows users to catch up on news, watch live streams, and of course, message friends. While this is already a great idea for an app, being able to incorporate their upcoming games could make for a more desirable app.<br>‍<br><br><strong class="bold-text-46">Preliminary Research</strong><br><br>To start off, I conducted research on a small sample group of 14 League+ users which consisted of young adults/students. The research consisted of a survey with 5 simple questions to determine what they liked and what they didn&#x27;t like about the current app.<br><br>Of the 14 respondents, <strong class="bold-text-8">13/14</strong> <strong class="bold-text-47">of the users used the app for messaging friends</strong> when they are away from their computer. When asked what they would like to see in the app, the most popular answer was to <strong class="bold-text-48">integrate a way to </strong><strong class="bold-text-9">spectate games</strong> of their friends from their mobile device. When asked what they would change about the app in general, the majority of the answers were along the lines of the app being <strong class="bold-text-51">unintuitive and clunky</strong>. For the final question, I wanted to see if there would be interest in a similar app but for all the games by Riot instead. <strong class="bold-text-10">6/14</strong> of users said maybe, <strong class="bold-text-11">3/14</strong> said likely, and <strong class="bold-text-12">4/14</strong> said they were extremely likely to use it.<br>‍<br><br><strong class="bold-text-45">Market Analysis<br>‍</strong><br>I also took a look at apps that would serve the same function as the app I was to design. From these similar apps, I was able to notice similarities between them which gave me inspiration towards how the my own app will turn out.<br></p>

Some users liked that it was a dark themed app and some did not, this told me that I should design a dark mode option.

All users found the task simple and more focused since it was in the middle of the action bar. The next task was to see how many of the users would utilize the search bar and/or filter button in the &quot;News&quot; tab. I asked users to find the most recent patch notes for League of Legends, and every user immediately went to the search bar, except for one user that wanted to filter the news by game and type of news.<br><br>Check out the prototype of the final product (light mode) here: <a href="https://invis.io/8Z110F5C6NBC#/452126735_Home" target="_blank">https://invis.io/8Z110F5C6NBC#/452126735_Home</a>

        <p class="paragraph-47">This is my favourite project to date because I was entirely in control of the ideation and processes which allowed me to explore and learn new design styles. Not to mention that I am also very passionate about this industry!<br><br>This project showed that although UI can make an app more appealing, digging in and finding out people&#x27;s habits will prove to be more influential in making a successful project. Ideally, I should have gotten a larger research sample to further back up my basis for my concept. That way I can truly say that the app is more user friendly for the entire player base.</p>
