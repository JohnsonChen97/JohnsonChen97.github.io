        <p class="paragraph-44"><strong>Research<br><br></strong>To start off, I conducted research on a small sample group of 14 League+ users. The research consisted of a survey with 5 simple questions to determine what they liked and what they didn&#x27;t like about the current app.<br><br>Of the 14 respondents, <strong class="bold-text-8">92.9%</strong> of the users used the app for messaging friends when they are away from their computer. When asked what they would like to see in the app, the most popular answer was to integrate a way to <strong class="bold-text-9">spectate games</strong> of their friends from their mobile device. For the final question, I wanted to see if there would be interest in a similar app but for all the games by Riot instead. <strong class="bold-text-10">42.9%</strong> of users said maybe, <strong class="bold-text-11">21.4%</strong> said likely, and <strong class="bold-text-12">28.6%</strong> said they were extremely likely to use it.<br><br>From this survey, I learned what users wanted to see and that there was actual interest in an app like this. This allowed me to get started on a user journey map based on the survey.<br></p>

        <h4 class="heading-27">Takeaways</h4>
        <p class="paragraph-47">This is my favourite project to date because I was entirely in control of the ideation and processes which allowed me to explore and learn new design styles. Not to mention that I am also very passionate about this industry!<br><br>I learned that sometimes, a redesign isn&#x27;t meant to be something that is blown out. User needs and wants will range, but as long as I am able to cater to them by creating a great experience for them when using the app, then it is considered a successful redesign. Since this is also my first redesign project, I learned to show restraint as I could&#x27;ve changed elements that were not an issue in the first place.<br>‍<br>The fact that I was designing an app for an already established company made me want to put in more effort in nailing down what users wanted. Ideally, I should have gotten a larger research sample to further back up my basis for my redesign. That way I can truly say that the app is more user friendly for the entire player base.</p>
