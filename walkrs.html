        <p class="paragraph-59"><strong>Research<br><br></strong>This project being the first time my group had to design for the elderly, we decided we had to talk to our audience directly. Before any of the design questions were brought out, we needed to find out what our target users actually wanted from an app. To find this out, my group and I went to a retirement home to interview a handful of people. We wanted to know their struggles and limitations in their daily lives. From these interviews, we came to the conclusion that they <strong class="bold-text-25">lack help or rather a healthy companion to assist them.</strong><br>‍<strong><br></strong>We conducted in person interviews at a mall during the morning hours. What we wanted to know was how to create an app that pleases the elderly. We asked questions to better understand what colours they like, contrast and sizing of text, and overall knowledge on technology.<br><br>What we got from our research is that the majority of our target users preferred comforting and calm colours such as blue and green paired with high contrast text. In terms of how knowledgeable they were with technology, many of the users were comfortable with using an app as long as it was accessible for them.<br><br>Considerations for the app:<br><br><strong class="bold-text-26">1.</strong> Blue or green as main colour for the app and brand.<br><br><strong class="bold-text-27">2.</strong> Clear text with a contrasting colour to the background.<br><br><strong class="bold-text-28">3.</strong> Simplistic interface that is not overwhelming for less technical individuals.<br><br>This information also allowed us to create a user journey map</p>

        <p class="paragraph-61">When converting the low fidelity mockups to high fidelity, we encountered problems that would&#x27;ve affected the user flow. So to fix this, we did some secondary research on other products that are also targeting the elderly or have a schedule like app.<br><br>When the high fidelity mockups were completed, we started on doing usability testing for both sides of the app. This helped us change anything that may not have been as clear as we imagined.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-67"><strong>Takeaways<br><br></strong>The amount of research I have done for this project really showed me what it takes to make a real app for a user category that I don&#x27;t fall into. I have learned that getting the primary research is what allows designers to create effective designs for specific needs. This was also the first time I utilized usability testing which was helpful in creating the final product. <br><br>I would say that I improved on a lot of things when it comes to designing in general. Being able to make choices based on user needs and adapting to different styles was greatly important. I believe that this whole experience will allow me to become the UX designer I want to be.</p>
