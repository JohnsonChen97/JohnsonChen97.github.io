Our design team of 6 people was relatively small compared to the size of the company and the amount of teams working on different projects. Each designer contributed to more than one project. This experience improved my ability to work in an agile environment because at times I would be switching from project to project within the day, or just working on multiple projects simultaneously.<br><br>My role as the UX Designer was to take the old existing platforms and update them to make them more intuitive while giving it a modern look. What contributed to this task was working with and adding to the multiple design systems we had in place. This created the consistency and visual update we needed for the rebranding. To find out what needed to change in terms of usability, I had to conduct interviews, research competitors, and have meetings with stakeholders. Throughout this entire process, I would consistently update my manager on where the project is heading and if I had any issues they could help me with. Since this was a rebuilding stage for TripArc, success was measured by how quickly we could bring data driven design solutions to life. During my time at TripArc, I worked on 3 different product lines, contributed to multiple projects within each line and worked independently on 2 projects as the designer.<br></p>

I had to create a new user flow that would allow for the bundling of flights, hotels, and car rentals. Our web app had the capabilities to book each service individually already and we wanted to expand our tools to be more competitive while making the agent&#x27;s jobs easier. For this project, I was the solo designer but I often went to my manager for feedback and help on any design problems I encountered. My manager is also the one that assigned me this project as I had worked on this web app (named ADX) previously and was familiar with the design system as I contributed to it.<br><br>Given the startup like culture we had at TripArc, we mostly worked with agile design processes. This project was a little different as I would not be working with devs as this was still a concept at the time that need more exploration from a UX standpoint. This prompted me to use a design thinking process that allowed me to research the needs, define the requirements, develop the wireframes and repeat as many times as necessary in order to deliver. <br></p><img src="images/double-diamond.png" loading="lazy" id="w-node-_87975556-5e6b-c74d-1dca-26d4f624c599-90648e23" sizes="(max-width: 835px) 100vw, 835px" alt="" srcset="images/double-diamond-p-500.png 500w, images/double-diamond.png 835w">

I created a streamlined process that also incorporated a function unique to our web app that allowed the user to compare their selections no matter what they were booking. Although this function was still in the works during my time there, I still made sure to include it into the flow for future reference.</p>
      <p id="w-node-_77661421-454f-ec7d-5714-146ab76cf6aa-90648e23" class="paragraph-99">First thing I did was I create some wireframes of the user flow to present later on in my interviews for usability testing and also so I could give an idea of what the new flow was. I decided that low fidelity wireframes were appropriate for my research as it allowed me to iterate quickly and get as many interviews in.</p>
      <p id="w-node-b88c712d-0925-fed7-d0f4-b28b48688dac-90648e23" class="paragraph-100">Now was the time for some interviews and research. In order to get an understanding of what exactly would fit our agent&#x27;s needs, I conducted 4 interviews to see what they liked about the current methods of bookings flights, hotels, and cars independently. Then I brought out the wireframes from earlier for usability testing while also hoping to garner interest for this new flow. The reason there were only 4 interviews was because I wanted to iterate as I go and was planning on doing more interviews down the road. With the user data I collected through these interview sessions, it let me make data driven design solutions that ultimately altered the mockups. <br><br><strong class="bold-text-53">Main takeaways for improvement:</strong><br><br><strong class="bold-text-54">1.</strong> Users preferred the already in place list views that we had for hotel and air. This was an oversight on my part as it made complete sense to have the screens be similar to existing flows.<br><br><strong class="bold-text-55">2</strong>. A lot of concern about filters when looking at the list of hotels and air. They were especially about if they would be relatively the same as the current ones or if we would be taking any of them away. Another thing a lot of agents brought up was being able to sort by distance to their points of interest to get the most well priced hotel in that area.<br><br><strong class="bold-text-56">3</strong>. Agents liked the hotel overview page as it gave them a lot more information than our primary hotel booking process. They especially wanted the design to expand on the map section to show nearby attractions or restaurants.</p>

They all claimed that it would be a great improvement to the overall product of ADX and liked the flow. These aren&#x27;t real results but it is assuring that the agents themselves were eager to use this new function.<br><br>This project taught me a lot about what it takes to get a product from inception to release. Being the only designer definitely pushed me to work harder as there was a lot more things that needed to be done compared to my previous projects at TripArc. A challenge I faced was not having a way to manage or record my progress. Usually, I would mark tasks complete or give story points in JIRA to keep me on task, but since this project was a concept that involved no other teams yet, I had to learn to self manage on my own. This was a big learning step for me as I had always previously used JIRA to update my tasks or even share progress with other people. To solve this, I had consistent meetings with my manager to give status updates and of course to get feedback.<br>‍<br>The time I spent on this project improved my skills in interviewing, writing, information architecture, communication and my overall technical skills in Figma. I personally thought that my weakest points were in interviewing users and some more technical parts of Figma, but this experience has allowed me to drastically improve upon these aspects and gain a lot of confidence. Even though there wasn&#x27;t really any collaboration with other teams, I was able to still work on my communication skills through leading interviews, talking with other product managers, and my daily updates to my manager.<br><br><br><strong class="bold-text-57">Conclusion of my time at TripArc</strong><br><br>Overall, my experience at TripArc has shaped the way I design. A lot of the work I did was directly impacting the people within the company since most of the products were used by our agents. This really motivated me to develop those relationships with colleagues and provide knowledge on best design practices to whoever I worked with. I got to cross collaborate with people from all departments, contribute to a large design system, and lead interviews. <br><br>Almost all the work I have done can&#x27;t be accessed by the public, but I still feel like I was designing for real users regardless. I still managed to gain experience that will only allow me to excel even more.</p>
      <p id="w-node-_583dc160-3feb-6500-fb1c-c1efbf49df75-90648e23" class="paragraph-102"><strong class="bold-text-61">Next steps:</strong><br><br>Before working on this project, I had planned to take some time off for personal reasons and to refocus my career aspirations, so unfortunately I was not able to complete this project and left soon after finishing this iteration of mockups. I still wanted to show this project because it felt exciting to be there for a new product from inception. Being what is essentially a product designer was an experience that I&#x27;m grateful to have during my time at TripArc and was an incredible learning opportunity to improve my skills across the board. <br><br>If I were to complete this project, my next steps would be do more interviews and usability tests with mainly the same agents as I previously talked to so I can continue to iterate. That way I can get not only their opinions on the changes they wanted, but also if they had any issues with navigating through the flow still. Additionally, I would have really liked to have this iteration live on the web app to get a more natural user interaction and collect data through heat maps. This would make my research more diverse and even more unbiased as I mainly interviewed agents that had experience with booking vacation packages on other websites.<br></p>
