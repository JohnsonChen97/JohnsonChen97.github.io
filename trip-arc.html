This included researching, designing, conducting interviews, and even creating logos/icons. My efforts went towards the new vision the company had for it&#x27;s arsenal of travel related tools as TripArc wanted to create new and better experiences for their agents and customers. <br><br>Our design team of 6 people was relatively small compared to the size of the company and the amount of teams working on different projects. Each designer contributed to more than one project. This experience improved my ability to work in an agile environment because at times I would be switching from project to project within the day, or just working on multiple projects simultaneously. Through consistent daily standups and meetings with devs and project managers, I was able to refine my capabilities in communicating with team members so that everyone would understand each other&#x27;s positions.<br><br>My role as the UX Designer was to take the old existing platforms and update them to make them more intuitive while giving it a modern look. What contributed to this task was working with and adding to the multiple design systems we had in place. This created the consistency and visual update we needed for the rebranding. To find out what needed to change in terms of usability, I had to conduct interviews, research competitors, and have meetings with stakeholders. Throughout this entire process, I would consistently update my manager on where the project is heading and if I had any issues they could help me with.<br><br>Working at TripArc has definitely improved my skills in multiple aspects. What I noticed was that my communication skills have improved due to the multiple team meetings and stand ups, not to mention talking with stakeholders which was something new to me previously. My technical skills in Figma have gotten better as well and I feel a lot more confident in my ability to churn out higher quality work. Although nothing is live yet, I&#x27;m grateful for the experienced IÂ have gained and the people I worked with.<br></p>
